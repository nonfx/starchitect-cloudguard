Starchitect-CloudGuard is an open-source repository dedicated to writing tests for cloud infrastructure across various formats, including Terraform, Pulumi, Bicep, and CloudFormation. These tests are crafted by cutting-edge AI-powered test-writing agents that operate with a well-defined understanding of cloud security. Each test undergoes meticulous human review by the experienced team at Nonfunction (nonfx.com), ensuring high-quality and reliable compliance validation.

This framework is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to write and manage tests in their preferred formats. While Terraform is the primary focus, support for additional use cases and formats is always growing. If you have specific requirements, feel free to open a GitHub issue, and our team will be happy to assist.
